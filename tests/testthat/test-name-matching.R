# Person-name compatibility primitives: the ported isochrones fixture suite
# =============================================================================
# The COMPLETE original fixture suite from isochrones
# tests/testthat/test-name-matching-primitives.R, ported verbatim (only the
# isochrones sourcing preamble removed). Fixture provenance labels are
# preserved from the source: observed / adjudicated observed /
# synthetic-adversarial. The parity section at the bottom is the migration
# proof: the same fixtures run against the ORIGINAL isochrones
# implementation when a local checkout is present, and every verdict must
# be identical -- zero unintended behavioral differences.
