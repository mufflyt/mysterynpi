# =============================================================================
# Person-name compatibility primitives, ported from mufflyt/isochrones
# =============================================================================
# PROVENANCE. Ported 2026-09-08 from isochrones R/name_matching_primitives.R
# (origin/main) during the owner-wide nickname consolidation, with behavior
# parity proven by running the complete original fixture suite against both
# implementations (tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R carries the parity
# section). Two seams were rewired onto this package's own canon and nothing
# else changed:
#   normalize_name_key(x)  ->  gsub("\\s+", " ", normalize_string(x))
#                              (the isochrones shim was ALWAYS exactly this
#                              composition over mysterynpi)
#   are_nickname_variants() -> nickname_agreement(x, y) == "corroborates"
#                              (one canonical nickname engine; these
#                              primitives only reach it with full tokens on
#                              both sides, where the relations coincide)
#
# WHY THESE LIVE HERE. They are generic person-record linkage mechanics --
# whole surname components instead of substrings, initials that never
# identify on their own, explicit caller-chosen comparison modes, refusal to
# recycle identity vectors -- not ABOG/Healthgrades/midwifery policy. Every
# rule encodes a defect that shipped somewhere real; the comments carry them.
#
# NAME_SURNAME_PARTICLES vs SURNAME_PARTICLES: deliberately TWO lists for
# now. SURNAME_PARTICLES guards the tokenization floor of surname_tokens();
# NAME_SURNAME_PARTICLES guards subset-nesting EVIDENCE (a particle alone
# never nests). The lists differ (MC/MAC vs AF/AV/OP/ZU ...); reconciling
# them is a reviewed data decision recorded as a consolidation follow-up,
# not a silent side effect of this port.

#' @title Canonical person-name matching primitives
#'
#' @description
#' Shared mechanics for deciding whether two person-name records describe the
#' same human, so that every consumer repository compares names ONE way
#' instead of each carrying its own. Ported from mufflyt/isochrones with
#' proven parity; see the file header for the two rewired seams.
#'
#' @section Two modes, chosen by the caller:
#' Given-name comparison is NOT one rule. It depends on whether the source
#' preserves name ORDER:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   structured <-> structured   (registry fields <-> registry fields)
#'       -> mode = "positional_ie"
#'
#'   unreliable free text <-> structured   (repository author string <-> record)
#'       -> mode = "any_token", with position retained as evidence
#' }
#'
#' **Mode is a property of the source contract, not of an individual person's
#' name.** These functions never inspect a string and guess which mode to use.
#' A library that sniffs "does this look like free text?" has buried an
#' unauditable scientific decision in a heuristic; the caller knows what it
#' holds and must say so.
#'
#' @section Evidence for two modes:
#' An external linkage experiment (AMCB midwifery project, 2026-08-16) ran both
#' rules over the same 35,038 repository author strings against 22,309
#' certificants, holding everything except candidate generation constant.
#' `any_token` produced a 19% permutation collision proxy and 165 ambiguous
#' projects; `positional_ie` produced 13% and 82. The 103-row difference was 23
#' middle-name-only matches, 67 ambiguity resolutions, and 13 high-evidence
#' links only `any_token` could reach -- people who publish under a middle name.
#'
#' Those percentages are PERMUTATION COLLISION PROXIES. They are not
#' false-positive rates, precision, sensitivity, specificity or accuracy: no
#' adjudicated truth set exists for those links. Neither mode dominated, which
#' is why both are kept.
#'
#' @section What is reused rather than reimplemented:
#' Normalization is [normalize_string()] with whitespace collapse, which
#' folds Unicode, transliterates Latin to ASCII, and collapses whitespace.
#' Nickname equivalence is [nickname_agreement()]. Nothing here re-derives
#' either.
#'
#' @family name-matching
#' @name name_matching_primitives
NULL

# Normalization happens INSIDE every primitive. A caller must not be able to
# recreate a case-sensitivity bug by passing raw input: an upstream tokenizer
# that split on [^A-Z'] returned zero tokens for mixed-case input and silently
# matched nobody, which is a contract that cannot live in a comment.

#'

#' Split a surname into comparable whole components
